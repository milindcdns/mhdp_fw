Fast discrete Fourier and cosine transforms and inverses
author: Monty <xiphmont@mit.edu>

/* These Fourier routines were originally based on the Fourier
routines of the same names from the NETLIB bihar and fftpack
fortran libraries developed by Paul N. Swarztrauber at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO USA.  They have been
reimplemented in C and optimized in a few ways for OggSquish. */

/* As the original fortran libraries are public domain, the C Fourier
routines in this file are hereby released to the public domain as
well.  The C routines here produce output exactly equivalent to the
original fortran routines.  Of particular interest are the facts
that (like the original fortran), these routines can work on
arbitrary length vectors that need not be powers of two in
length. */
