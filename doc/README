[ How to read FW version ? ]

Version of binary is stored in two 8b registers: SW_VER_H and SW_VER_L.
Version is represented by 3 values (major, minor and update), but in registers is stored in decimal format. Example:

version = SW_VER_H << 8 | SW_VER_L = 20000

| major | minor | update |
|   2   |  00   |   00   |

Version number is 2.0.0

Numbers in decimal format (XYYZZ) of version could be presented symbolic as:
X - major number
YY - minor number
ZZ - update number
